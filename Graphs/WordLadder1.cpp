/*
    We can go to other word from one word. We can only jump to the word from word list.
    This is a Undirected Graph and we need to find the minimum distance in this graph from source to destination.
    We can apply a clean BFS.

    To solve this questions we can
    1. Create the graph and then do the BFS 
    2. Start doing the BFS by applying the graph making logic without actually making the graph
        -> While determining what is the next node, add that node in the queue directly.
